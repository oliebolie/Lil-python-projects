Little project, prob needs some tweaking.
Was prob tweaking while making.
Only requirements are the time module
This program should allow you to make "Scrolling" or "Falling" ascii art.
By that I mean art drawn line by line, possibly at an interval if you want to make a fancy revealing logo, as demonstrated in the opening sequence of my lockness OS project.
